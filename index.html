        <h2> My Favorite Hobby</h2> <br>
        <p> My favorite hobby? Well, I have more than one favorite hobby. I have a lot of hobbies dedicated to summer break! When my parents are at work, I have to have tasks to do for that amount of time in the weekdays. I also have plans, BIG plans for the weekends! I have a lot to do when my mom and dad aren't free. And a lot of time as 3 months, so if not today, there's always a tomorrow!</p>
